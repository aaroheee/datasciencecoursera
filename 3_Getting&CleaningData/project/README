Getting and Cleaning Data Project
Author: Arohi Parlikar


Goal of the Project
    A tidy data set
    A link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis
    A code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. You should also include a README.md in the repo with your scripts. This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.
